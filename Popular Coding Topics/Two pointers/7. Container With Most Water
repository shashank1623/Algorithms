Problem statement:-

You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Notice that you may not slant the container.

solution:-

class Solution {
public:
    int maxArea(vector<int>& height) {
        int water = 0;
    int i = 0, j = height.size() - 1;
    while (i < j) {
        int h = min(height[i], height[j]);
        water = max(water, (j - i) * h);
        while (height[i] <= h && i < j) i++;
        while (height[j] <= h && i < j) j--;
    }
    return water;
    }
};
