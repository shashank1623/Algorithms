Problem statement:-A car travels from a starting position to a destination which is target miles east of the starting position.

There are gas stations along the way. The gas stations are represented as an array stations where stations[i] = [positioni, fueli] indicates that the ith gas station is positioni miles east of the starting position and has fueli liters of gas.

The car starts with an infinite tank of gas, which initially has startFuel liters of fuel in it. It uses one liter of gas per one mile that it drives. When the car reaches a gas station, it may stop and refuel, transferring all the gas from the station into the car.

Return the minimum number of refueling stops the car must make in order to reach its destination. If it cannot reach the destination, return -1.

Note that if the car reaches a gas station with 0 fuel left, the car can still refuel there. If the car reaches the destination with 0 fuel left, it is still considered to have arrived.


solution:-
class Solution {
public:
    int minRefuelStops(int target, int startFuel, vector<vector<int>>& stations) {
        int n = stations.size();
        
        vector<vector<ull>> t(n+1, vector<ull>(n+1, 0));
        //t[i][j] = Maximum distance reached if I stopped at 'j' fuelStops from total of 'i' fuelStops
        //i.e. j <= i
        
        //If j = 0, i.e. I did not use any fuelStops, Then maximum I can reach is 'startFuel' which I had initially
        
        //So, initialize the dp array with this information
        for(int i = 0; i<n+1; i++) {
            t[i][0] = startFuel;
        }
        
        //There is no point of filling 1st row because 
        //t[0][j] means I used j fuelStops from 0 fuelStops which doesn't make any sense for (j>0)
        //That's why I start from i = 1 and obviously j = 1 because for j = 0 we already populated the dp array
        
        for(int i = 1; i < n+1; i++) {
            for(int j = 1; j <= i; j++) { //I can use j=1 to j=i fuel stops and find max distance for t[i][j]
                //case-1 (I don't refuel at current fuelstop)
                //If I didn't refuel at current stop, the max distance I can cover is equal to maximum
                //distance I could cover from previous state
                t[i][j] = t[i-1][j];
                
                //case-2 (I will refuel at current fuelStop)
                //But check if you can even reach this station (stations[i-1][0]) or not from your previous station
                if(t[i-1][j-1] >= stations[i-1][0]) {
                    t[i][j] = max(t[i][j], t[i-1][j-1] + stations[i-1][1]);
                }
                
            }
        }
        
        //After you end up with all stations, check which t[n][j] was best for reaching target
        //Best means, minimum j used by you to reach target
        for(int j = 0; j<n+1; j++) {
            if(t[n][j] >= target)
                return j;
        }
        
        //You could never reach target, so return -1
        return -1;
    }
};
